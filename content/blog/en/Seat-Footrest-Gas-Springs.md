# How to Find a Replacement for Seat Footrest Gas Springs

Seat footrest gas springs, like the **SUSPA Gas Spring Seat Footrest C16-32018**, are vital for smooth, controlled movement in chairs, recliners, and commercial seating. If you need to replace one, follow this guide to find an economical and compatible solution.

## What is a Seat Footrest Gas Spring?

A seat footrest gas spring uses compressed nitrogen gas to assist in lifting and lowering footrests in chairs. It consists of a cylinder and a piston rod, generating force to offset the footrest’s weight. You’ll find them in recliner chairs, barber chairs, commercial vehicle seating, and drafting stools.

## Step 1: Identify Specifications of the Old Gas Spring (Using SUSPA C16-32018 as a Reference)

To find a replacement, extract key details from the original gas spring:

- **Force (in Newtons):** Look for a number followed by “N” on the cylinder. For SUSPA C16-32018, check the label for its force rating (e.g., 100N, 150N).
- **Extended Length:** Measure from the center of one end fitting to the other when the footrest is fully extended.
- **Compressed Length:** Measure the distance between the two end fittings when the footrest is fully closed.
- **End Fittings:** Note the type (e.g., screw eyes, ball heads) to ensure compatibility.

## Step 2: Search for Replacements Using Specifications

With the specs in hand, use these strategies:

- **Online Search Tools:** Enter specifications like “100N seat footrest gas spring, extended length 200mm, compressed length 100mm” into search engines or specialized gas spring sites.
- **Cross-Reference Databases:** Look for databases that list equivalents for SUSPA models like C16-32018. Brands like DK Gas Spring, Hinscha, or Suspa itself may offer direct replacements.
- **Supplier Consultation:** Reach out to gas spring suppliers and provide the specs—they can help identify cost-effective alternatives.

## Step 3: Verify Compatibility and Install

- **End Fittings:** Ensure the new gas spring’s fittings match the old one. If not, check if you can reuse the old fittings or if adapters are available.
- **Installation:** Once you have the replacement, install it by aligning the end fittings with the chair’s mounting points. Test the movement to ensure smooth, controlled operation.
