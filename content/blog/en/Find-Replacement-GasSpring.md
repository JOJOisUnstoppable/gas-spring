# How to Find the Right Replacement Gas Spring

When you need to replace a gas spring and the part number (like SX150P-10) doesn't match standard models in searches, it can be frustrating. But don't worry! This guide will walk you through finding the perfect replacement, whether you're a DIYer or a professional.

## Why Part Numbers Might Not Match

Part numbers such as SX150P-10 often don't correspond to standard gas spring models. They could be specific to brands like Singauture, JR Products, or DK Gas Spring. However, by following these steps, you'll be able to source a suitable replacement.

## Step - by - Step Replacement Process

### 1. Identify the Manufacturer

Look for a brand name on the gas spring label or its packaging. Well - known brands include AVM, JR Products, Nitro Prop, and, of course,[**DK Gas Spring**](https://www.dkgasspring.com/en/products/category/gas-spring)

Knowing the manufacturer is the first key step.

### 2. Measure Essential Specifications

Accurate measurements are vital for a proper replacement:

- **Extended Length**: Measure from the center of one end fitting to the center of the other when the spring is fully extended.
- **Compressed Length**: Measure from the center of one end fitting to the center of the other when the spring is fully compressed.
- **Force**: Look for a number followed by "N" (Newton) printed on the spring—this shows the force it provides.

### 3. Determine End Fitting Types

Identify the kind of end fittings, such as ball - joint sockets. Also, check if your setup needs a specific bracket or stud.

### 4. Search Using Collected Details

Use the information you've gathered to search for a compatible gas spring. For example, search for:

- "30 lb, 20 inch extended, universal gas spring"
- "300 N, 195 mm extended, DK gas spring"

## Example: Replacing SX150P-10

Take SX150P-10 as an example. Since it's not a standard model, the steps above are useful. A common replacement for similar uses is the gas spring, with a force of 10 lbs, an extended length of 150 inches, and a compressed length of 11.41 inches. At DK Gas Spring, we have equivalents matching various force and length needs.
