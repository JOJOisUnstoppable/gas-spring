## Subheading

This is a paragraph of ordinary text:

When I observe the magnificent scenery of Baling, it lies in the Dongting Lake. It embraces distant mountains and swallows the Yangtze River, vast and boundless, stretching endlessly; the morning light and evening shadows present a myriad of scenes. This is the grand view of Yueyang Tower, and the predecessors have described it thoroughly. However, it connects to the Wu Gorge in the north and reaches Xiaoxiang in the south. Travelers and poets often gather here, and their feelings upon viewing the scenery must differ. If there is continuous rain, lasting for months without clearing, with bitter winds howling and muddy waves surging; the sun and stars hide their brilliance, and the mountains and hills disappear; merchants and travelers cannot proceed, masts collapse and oars break; at dusk, it is dark and gloomy, with tigers roaring and monkeys crying. Climbing this tower, one feels the sorrow of leaving home, worries about slander and ridicule, and is filled with desolation, feeling extreme sadness. But when spring is warm and the scenery is bright, the waves are calm, and the sky and water blend into one vast expanse; sand gulls gather, and fish swim gracefully; the shores are covered with fragrant plants, lush and green. Or when the mist clears and the bright moon shines for thousands of miles, the shimmering light dances like gold, and the still reflection sinks like jade, with fishermen singing in responseâ€”how joyful it is! Climbing this tower, one feels refreshed and carefree, forgetting both honor and disgrace, holding wine in hand and facing the wind, filled with boundless joy.

> How can we get thousands of spacious houses to shelter all the poor scholars of the world and make them happy! Unshaken by wind and rain, as stable as a mountain.
> > Alas! When will such a house suddenly appear before my eyes? Even if my hut alone is destroyed and I freeze to death, I would be content!
