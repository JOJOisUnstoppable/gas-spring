# How to Find a Replacement for Stabilus Lift-o-mat 706817 0460N Gas Spring

When you need to replace a Stabilus Lift-o-mat 706817 0460N gas spring, following a structured approach ensures you find a compatible and reliable alternative. Let’s break down the process step by step.

## Step 1: Identify Key Specifications of the Original Gas Spring

Start by extracting the critical details from the Stabilus Lift-o-mat 706817:

- **Force**: 460N
- **Model Number**: 706817
- **Brand**: Stabilus Lift-o-mat
These specs are the foundation for your replacement search.

## Step 2: Search for Direct Replacements

Use the gathered specifications to find alternatives:

- **Check Cross-Reference Databases**: Platforms like [gasspringsshop.com](http://gasspringsshop.com/) or industry-specific sites often list direct replacements for Stabilus models. Search using the part number *706817* or force rating *460N*.
- **Explore Alternate Brands**: Manufacturers like [DKGASSPRING](https://dkgasspring.com/) offer equivalents for the Stabilus Lift-o-mat series. Look for with 460N force, matching dimensions, and end fittings to the Stabilus 706817.

## Step 3: Verify Dimensions and End Fittings

To ensure a perfect fit, confirm these details:

- **Extended/Compressed Lengths**: Measure these from the original spring (or refer to Stabilus documentation if available). Mismatched lengths can lead to installation issues.
- **End Fitting Types**: Check if the spring uses ball-joint sockets, studs, or custom brackets. For example, if the original has “eye” fittings (common in Lift-o-mat models), the replacement must match.

## Step 4: Consult Supplier Resources

Leverage expert help to refine your search:

- **Reach Out to Specialized Suppliers**: Companies like  [DKGASSPRING](https://dkgasspring.com/) or gas spring distributors can identify alternatives when you provide the model number, force, and dimension details.
- **Use Calculation Tools**: If exact specs are unclear, use online gas spring calculators. Input your application’s requirements (e.g., stroke, mounting points) to generate compatible replacement options.

## Step 5: Avoid Common Pitfalls

Keep these tips in mind to ensure success:

- **Prioritize Quality**: Opt for brands with proven durability (e.g., Hinscha, Suspa) to match Stabilus’s performance standards.
- **Check Installation Compatibility**: Ensure the alternative fits existing mounting points without modification.
