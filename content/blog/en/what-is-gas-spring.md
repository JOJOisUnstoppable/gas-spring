## What is Gas Spring?

Gas spring hinge( also called gas struts)  is mainly for following functions:

1. Buffers load impact in machinery and equipment
2. Avoids collision damage and eliminate noise
3. Increases circulation speed
4. Improves user experience.
It is widely used in industries, like automation, robotics, furniture, fitness equipment, automobiles, and medical equipment. As we all know, gas struts with its functions as support, cushioning, braking, height adjustment angle and degree adjustment.

Gas springs manufacturing procedure is as following:

Use the pressure difference acting on the cross section of the piston rod to complete the free movement.

Fill a closed cylinder with inert gas or a mixture of oil and gas with a certain pressure difference from the outside atmospheric pressure.

## Conclusion

The biggest difference between gas spring and general mechanical spring:
1. For a general mechanical spring, its force changes greatly with the movement, while the force value of it remains basically unchanged during the whole movement.
2. For general steel springs, with a certain external dimension, there is only one force.But for gas spring hinge, the one of the same size can be made into different forces.
