# How to Find a Gas Spring Replacement: Taking PN 292575 as an Example

When you come across a non - standard part number like **PN 292575**, finding a suitable replacement might seem challenging. But let's use this case—where PN 292575 is a non - standard replacement for the Stabilus Lift - O - Mat 752975 gas spring—to show you how to navigate the process.

## The Case of PN 292575: A Non - Standard Yet Identifiable Gas Spring

A client once asked us about PN 292575. This isn't a standard part number. After investigation, we found it's a product from Stabilus, but not a standard Stabilus part number. It acts as a replacement for the Stabilus Lift - O - Mat 752975 gas spring. Here are its key specs:

- **Force**: 400N
- **Cylinder Diameter**: 19mm
- **Piston Rod Diameter**: 8mm
- **Total Extended Length**: 585mm
- **End Fitting**: Designed for a 10mm ball socket

## Step - by - Step Guide to Finding a Gas Spring Replacement

### 1. Investigate the Part Number and Brand Clues

Start by looking into the provided part number (like PN 292575). Even if it's not standard, it might be linked to a well - known brand (such as Stabilus in this case). Search for the part number online, check industry databases, or reach out to manufacturers or suppliers.

### 2. Identify the Original or Equivalent Standard Model

Try to find the original or a standard model it replaces. For PN 292575, it replaces the Stabilus Lift - O - Mat 752975. Once you have this, you can use the standard model as a reference.

### 3. Extract Key Specifications

Gather all the technical details of the gas spring:

- **Force (in Newtons or Pounds)**: This tells you how much support the spring provides. In our example, it's 400N.
- **Cylinder and Piston Rod Diameters**: These affect the spring's strength and durability. Here, the cylinder is 19mm and the piston rod is 8mm.
- **Extended and Compressed Lengths**: The total extended length here is 585mm. Don't forget to find the compressed length too if possible.
- **End Fittings**: The type of end fittings (like the 10mm ball socket here) is crucial for compatibility.

### 4. Search for Replacements Using Specifications

With the specs in hand, search for gas springs that match. You can use queries like:

- "400N gas spring, 19mm cylinder, 8mm piston rod, 585mm extended, 10mm ball socket"

### 5. Verify Compatibility with Your Application

Make sure the replacement gas spring fits your equipment or project. To get sample from DK, check the mounting points, space constraints, and operational requirements.
