          A compression gas spring is a versatile industrial component that excels in supporting, buffering, braking, and adjusting height and angle. When the compression gas spring operates, the pressure difference between the two sides of the piston (driven by the high - pressure gas in the cylinder) causes the piston rod to move. Compared with ordinary springs, compression gas springs have significant advantages: the speed of movement can be customized, the power change during operation is small, and they are easy to control.<br>As shown in the diagram, here's a breakdown of its structure and how it works:

      KeyComponents:
        Title: 'Key Components'
        List:
          - name: ”Connecting Parts“
            desc: “These two parts act as the connection points. Click to see various fittings.”
          - name: “Cylinder (Powder-coated)”
            desc: ”The cylinder is the main body of the gas spring. It's powder - coated, which not only gives it a durable finish but also provides protection. Inside this sealed cylinder, there is gas.“
          - name: “Gas”
            desc: “Inert gas or a gas - oil mixture is filled within the cylinder at a pressure several to dozens of times that of the atmosphere. This high pressure is the driving force behind the gas spring's operation.”
          - name: “Piston Rod”
            desc: “It transmits the force generated by the pressure difference inside the cylinder to the external load, enabling linear movement.”
          - name: “Sealing Ring”
            desc: “This ensures that the high - pressure gas inside the cylinder doesn't leak out, maintaining the necessary pressure for the gas spring to function properly.”
          - name: “Bushing”
            desc: “It guides the piston rod, reducing friction during its movement and ensuring smooth operation.”
          - name: “Grease Chamber”
            desc: “It contains grease that lubricates the moving parts, further reducing friction and wear, thus extending the service life of the gas spring.”
      InstallAndUsage:
        Title: 'Installation and Usage'
        Installation:
          Title: 'Installation'
          Desc: 'The position of the piston rod must be adjusted downward according to the load to reduce friction and ensure good damping and buffering performance. When a retractable spring is compressed, it must move past the midline as it closes; otherwise, the connected component (like a door) may open unexpectedly. Before determining the installation position, select the gas spring according to the specified model and specifications in the manual.'
        Usage:
          Title: 'Usage'
          Desc: 'During use, the compression gas spring should not be subjected to tilting or lateral forces. The piston rod is not painted, and painting should not be done after the gas spring is installed in position. Since it is a high - pressure product, do not disassemble it at will. Also, avoid baking, rolling, or rotating the piston rod to the left.'

    description: LGS stands for Locking Gas Spring. It is a type of gas spring that has a locking mechanism built into it.
    Desc: 'LGS stands for Locking Gas Spring. It is a type of gas spring that has a locking mechanism built into it. This means that once the spring is compressed, it cannot be released unless the locking mechanism is broken. LGS is commonly used in applications where it is necessary to ensure that the spring is compressed to a certain point before it can be released. For example, in a door lock, the LGS is used to ensure that the door is locked when the key is removed.'

    description: 'Stainless steel gas springs are a specialized version of standard gas springs.'
    Desc: 'Stainless steel gas springs are a specialized version of standard gas springs. While sharing core functions like force generation, customizable sizing, and damping options, their key difference lies in construction material—they use high-grade stainless steel (V2A/304 or V4A/316L) for superior corrosion resistance in harsh conditions where standard carbon steel fails.'

The pressure cylinder is a hermetically sealed cavity, filled with inert gas or an oil-gas mixture, and the pressure inside the cavity is several to dozens of times that of atmospheric pressure. Under the action of the gas spring, the movement of the piston rod is achieved through the pressure difference on both sides of the piston.'

    description: 'Compared with standard gas springs, standard gas springs provide thrust force, while tension gas springs provide tension force.'
    Diff:
      Desc: 'The main difference between standard gas springs and tension gas springs (Gas Traction Springs) lies in the direction of the force they generate.'
      List:
        - name: 'Standard gas springs:'
          desc: 'Generate a push-out or pushing force. When not subjected to external forces, they tend to extend the piston rod, providing a type of thrust force (denoted as F1).'
        - name: 'Tension gas springs:'
          desc: 'Generate a pull-in or pulling force. When not subjected to external forces, they tend to shorten the piston rod, providing a type of tension force (denoted as F3 and F4). Tension gas springs can also be equipped with damping control as required. Similar to standard gas springs, tension gas springs are not suitable for use as stroke limit stops.'
      EndDesc: 'Due to installation constraints, compression gas springs cannot usually be used; examples include horizontally hinged doors and access panels at the bottom, as well as any covers or cover plates that must be pulled open or closed. Tension gas springs are also commonly used as tensioners for mechanical components and belt drives.'
