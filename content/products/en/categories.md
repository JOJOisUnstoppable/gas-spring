    whatIsTitle: What is a gas spring?
    whatIsDesc: Gas springs are hydro-pneumatic energy storage components utilizing nitrogen and oil to provide compressible and damping media. They consist of a precision piston rod moving within a sealed cylinder filled with pressurized nitrogen and oil.
    principalTitle: Working Principle & Customization
    principalDesc: The spring force (F) is calculated as the pressure differential (ΔP) between the internal and external environments acting on the piston rod area (A) F = ΔP * A. Specifications can be tailored by adjusting nitrogen injected, oil quantity, and piston rod area to meet specific application requirements.
