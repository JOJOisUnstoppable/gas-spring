    At home, out shopping, in the office, or on vacation - The ability to easily move furniture and devices to our exact needs and habits is a component of quality of life. 
    That’s certainly also true for health and for medical care. Here, ergonomic work practices are just as critical as safety and a quiet atmosphere for the patient. 
    Our products prove their worth day after day in all of these areas. They damp impacts and sound, make gliding movements possible, and contribute to quiet and vibration-free operation of devices. The result? Truly enjoying recreational time, productive work, and optimal support in treatment and healing.
