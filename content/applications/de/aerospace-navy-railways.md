description: |
    Trains, ships, aircrafts – they all travel and fly safely and gently while vibrations and impacts are cushioned. Moving parts such as panels smoothly glide open, closed, up, and down. 
    This is how we are contributing to comfortable travel and optimized working conditions on board. Likewise, we’re helping to prevent wear effectively and to optimize performance.

    Maintenance-access panels, luggage racks, seat backs, pantograph isolation—our corrosion-resistant, vibration-damped gas springs keep weight down and cycles up for aircraft, ships and rail vehicles.
