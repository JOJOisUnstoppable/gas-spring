title: Aerospace, Navy, And Railways
description: |
    Trains, ships, aircrafts – they all travel and fly safely and gently while vibrations and impacts are cushioned. Moving parts such as panels smoothly glide open, closed, up, and down. 
    This is how we are contributing to comfortable travel and optimized working conditions on board. Likewise, we’re helping to prevent wear effectively and to optimize performance.
solution: |
    Bonnet, tailgate, seat tilt or battery-cover: compact gas springs with calibrated damping give OEMs the lowest opening effort, clean visual integration and 50 000-cycle durability required by passenger-car specs.
