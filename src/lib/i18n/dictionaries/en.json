            "q": "① Can the initial pull force be reduced below 80 N?",
            "a": "Answer: It can be reduced to 60 N, but this requires lowering the nitrogen pressure, which will reduce the service life by 20%. We recommend starting at 100 N. This is because excessively low initial pressure increases the gas expansion coefficient, affecting long-term stability."
          },
          {
            "q": "② The force progression in the single tube is too high, can it be improved?",
            "a": "Answer: Switch to a Double Tube structure for a flatter force curve, at an approx. 30% increase in cost. The double tube design reduces the force progression rate from 100 N → 170-180 N to 100 N → ~150 N by diverting damping."

          {
            "q": "③ What is the fastest lead time?",
            "a": "Answer: Conventional 150/250 N, 150/200 mm stroke single tube blanks are stocked (500 units), shipping within 72 hours; non-standard items take 10 days. We maintain inventory on common specifications to ensure rapid response."
          },
          {
            "q": "④ Certifications and Export?",
            "a": "Answer: Default certifications include RoHS and 48h Salt Spray Test; military-grade products require additional MIL-STD-810G vibration testing, adding 7 days to the cycle. All products comply with the EU RoHS directive and can be exported directly to European and American markets."

          {
            "q": "⑤ I want to conceal the anti-detachment pin on the end fitting?",

          "Gas springs—also known as gas struts or gas dampers—work by using compressed nitrogen gas as an elastic energy storage material within a sealed metal cylinder. The cylinder also contains a small amount of hydraulic oil (such as lubricating or damping oil). These oils serve three main functions:",

          "Lubricate moving parts to reduce wear.",
          "Provide damping.",
          "When you push the piston rod into the cylinder (this is the **compression** process), the space available for the nitrogen gas gets smaller. Just like squeezing a balloon makes the pressure inside go up, this smaller volume causes the gas pressure inside the cylinder to rise—this follows [Boyle’s Law](https://www.britannica.com/science/Boyles-law).",
          "The force the gas spring puts out gets stronger as you push the rod in, and it’s strongest when the rod is fully pressed into the cylinder. This more steady, reliable force than coil spring, is why gas springs are used in everyday things like car tailgates (to hold them open gently), industrial machines (to control movement), and ergonomic furniture (like adjustable office chairs)."
