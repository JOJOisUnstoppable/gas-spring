          "Gas springs—also known as gas struts or gas dampers—work by using compressed nitrogen gas as an elastic energy storage material within a sealed metal cylinder. The cylinder also contains a small amount of hydraulic oil (such as lubricating or damping oil). These oils serve three main functions:",

          "Lubricate moving parts to reduce wear.",
          "Provide damping.",
          "When you push the piston rod into the cylinder (this is the **compression** process), the space available for the nitrogen gas gets smaller. Just like squeezing a balloon makes the pressure inside go up, this smaller volume causes the gas pressure inside the cylinder to rise—this follows [Boyle’s Law](https://www.britannica.com/science/Boyles-law).",
          "The force the gas spring puts out gets stronger as you push the rod in, and it’s strongest when the rod is fully pressed into the cylinder. This more steady, reliable force than coil spring, is why gas springs are used in everyday things like car tailgates (to hold them open gently), industrial machines (to control movement), and ergonomic furniture (like adjustable office chairs)."
